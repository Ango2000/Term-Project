# Term Project Proposal

## The Big Idea

The main idea of this project is to create a web interface for players of the game League of Legends. The interface will help individual players to choose their champions "characters" that would best suit the situation during their turn in a draft phase. The interface will have the user fill in what has happened in the draft phase so far and the interface will give an output of the composition of both teams so far to help the user to make an educated decision on what they should pick for their champion. The MVP product will be a basic web page that the user can fill out the champions picked so far on each team and there will be an output box to display the characteristics and features of the team composition so far. The stretch goal will be a more advance interface where the user can drag and drop champions (champion picturs) into the designated pick order and give detailed characteristics of the team composition based on unique combinations of each champion picked or in other words the synergy between the champions picked so far. This will further help the user understand what may be the best champion to pick in the situation. 

## Learning Objectives

I want to use this project to learn how to effectively pull data from an API into a custom made web interface to give an accurate or intended output.

## Implementation Plan

I will be using the Riot Game's API to pull champion data for each champion in the game. I will then use Python to pull specific data that is relevant. I will then create a web interface that will take the inputs of the user to then pull the data to the front end so that the user can view it. 

## Project Schedule

### Week 1: November 12 - 18

This first week I will spend the majority of the time to pull all the data from the API into a json format and adjust the data to my needs. I will also develop python code to pull the data and since the data is very clean, there is no need to do any data cleaning. 

### Week 2: November 19 - 25

The second week I will be developing the web interface that will be pulling the data and giving an output to the user. This web interface will generally be just an outline to help prototype what the final product will be.

### Week 3: November 26 - December 4

This last week and a half will be used to finalize the project and meetings with the professor about any improvements that could be done.

## Collaboration Plan

No team collaboration

## Risks and Limitations

What poses the biggest threat to this project is the sheer number of champions playable in the game which can make determining synergies very tedious and complex
